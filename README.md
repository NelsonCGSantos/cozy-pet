# Cozy Pet (Bird Nest)

A tiny, always-on-top cozy window that will show a little nest where eggs hatch into birds and grow over time.

## Project status
- Current file: PyQt demo window with a floating blob.
- Next steps: add Bird/Season logic and (optionally) dev timers for fast testing.

## Dev setup
1. Create & activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
